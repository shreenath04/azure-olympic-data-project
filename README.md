# azure-olympic-data-project
Data engineering project based on the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Participants data.
The project showcases my skills in Azure, Apache Spark, ETL Pipeline, Data Ingestion, Data Manipulation

This entire project is created using the following Azure services:
  - Data Factory for creating the pipeline which extracts data from this repository
  - Databricks for writing the spark code in a Jupyter Notebook which transforms data

The project uses Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for storing the data.
Labgauge used to manipulate data, create transformed files and saving it at correct location is Apache Spark
